## [2026-03-21] Git wrapup: 4 commits across 2 repos

**Category:** `milestone`
**Tags:** `git`, `tl-schema-org`, `plans`, `scripts`

### Summary
Committed and pushed all session work across both repos with semantic commit grouping.

### Detail
- `tl-agent-skills-platform`: 2 commits — archived 15 completed plans to `plans-complete/`, added 2 new active plans (schema.org skill, skills promotion evaluation)
- `tl-agent-skills`: 2 commits — added `tl-schema-org` quilted skill (15 files, 23k+ lines), added `scripts/update-global-skills.ps1` utility
- `.cursor/rules/design-system.mdc` was already tracked — initial git status snapshot was stale

### Related
- Commits: `4a7b18d`, `f68e6e9` (platform), `e996bc7`, `c03f26a` (skills)

## [2026-03-21] Reverse QA validation: 7/7 scenarios passed

**Category:** `milestone`
**Tags:** `tl-schema-org`, `qa`, `validation`

### Summary
Stress-tested the completed skill by "using" it for 7 hypothetical tasks, then verified every claim against Schema.org V30.0 CSV data, official website, Google docs, and UNECE vocabulary.

### Detail
- Verified all types, properties, and enum URIs referenced in the skill exist in the official V30.0 CSV files
- Confirmed all 9 UN/CEFACT unit codes (APZ, GRM, KGM, ONZ, MMT, CMT, INH, MTR, LBR) against the official UNECE vocabulary at vocabulary.uncefact.org
- Validated rich results requirements (Product, Event, Article, FAQPage) match Google's current structured data docs
- Found one inaccuracy: frontmatter claimed "827 types, 1528 properties" but actual V30.0 counts are 1245 core types (non-enum, non-pending), 1532 core properties, plus 632 enum members and 460 pending terms. Fixed.
- Extension guidance, OpenAPI property ranges, and database modeling patterns all verified correct

## [2026-03-21] tl-schema-org skill implementation complete

**Category:** `milestone`
**Tags:** `tl-schema-org`, `quilted-skill`, `schema-org`

### Summary
Completed implementation of the comprehensive Schema.org quilted skill — 15 files covering the full vocabulary with machine-readable data, 7 reference docs, and cross-platform update scripts.

### Detail
- `SKILL.md`: 502 lines covering 7 core sections (fundamentals, JSON-LD, extensions, DB modeling, API interop, rich results, version tracking)
- `data/`: 4 machine-readable Schema.org V30.0 files (types CSV, properties CSV, tree.jsonld, jsonldcontext.json) plus VERSION stamp
- `references/`: 7 deep-dive docs (taxonomy-guide, json-ld-patterns, extension-patterns, database-modeling, api-interoperability, rich-results, version-tracking)
- `scripts/`: Both bash and PowerShell variants of update-schema-data for fetching latest Schema.org releases
- All examples use generic domains only — no project-specific references anywhere in the skill

## [2026-03-21] Content filtering: removed private project references

**Category:** `architecture`
**Tags:** `tl-schema-org`, `content-policy`, `quilting`

### Summary
Removed all local/private project source references from the published SKILL.md after explicit user instruction that private sources are for agent reference only, not for inclusion in the public skill.

### Detail
- Removed `local://` source entries from SKILL.md quilted frontmatter (vip-playbook, catalog-parametric-search, tl-live-music-data, private-collectibles-ecommerce, private-concert-data-api)
- Rebalanced source weights across remaining public sources (community skills, schema.org docs, Google docs, W3C)
- Replaced one project-specific example (`jambase:228924`) with generic identifier (`internal:228924`) in api-interoperability.md
- Private sources remain documented in the plan file for internal reference but do not appear in any published file
- The novel patterns extracted from private projects (two-tier extensions, field ordering, enum mapping, DB-driven property routing) are presented as generic production patterns without attribution to specific codebases

## [2026-03-21] Tone decision: quiet confidence over bragging

**Category:** `design`
**Tags:** `tl-schema-org`, `tone`, `voice`

### Summary
Established the voice for the skill: demonstrate deep expertise through depth and specificity rather than explicit claims of superiority.

### Detail
- User wanted the skill to convey competence without being boastful — "don't BRAG but it's okay to let whoever is reading know we think we're awesome just a little bit"
- Approach: let the content speak for itself. The description says "Not just SEO markup." The structure covers database modeling and API design — areas no other schema skill touches. The machine-readable data files and update scripts signal production-grade tooling. The two-tier extension system and enum mapping tables clearly come from shipped systems, not blog posts.
- Plan document captures this as: "a master craftsman showing you their workshop: they don't tell you it's impressive, but the tools on the wall and the quality of the workbench say everything"

## [2026-03-21] Architecture: machine-readable data over curated lists

**Category:** `architecture`
**Tags:** `tl-schema-org`, `taxonomy`, `data-files`

### Summary
Decided to ship Schema.org's official CSV/JSON-LD release files with the skill and teach agents to query them at runtime, rather than curating a subset of "important" types.

### Detail
- The user specified "the Entire and I mean entire taxonomy" — curated tier lists would always be incomplete and stale
- Schema.org publishes machine-readable files at each release: types CSV (2040 rows), properties CSV (1809 rows), tree.jsonld (hierarchy), jsonldcontext.json (context)
- Agent queries the CSV at runtime to verify type existence, check property domains/ranges, and find related types
- Update scripts (`update-schema-data.sh` / `.ps1`) fetch the latest release and write a VERSION stamp so the agent knows which version it's working with
- Trade-off: adds ~3.5MB to the skill. Accepted because accuracy across 1245 core types matters more than file size.

### Related
- Alternatives considered: (1) hardcoded type lists — rejected, would be stale immediately; (2) fetch from schema.org at runtime — rejected, requires network and adds latency; (3) curated tiers (essential/common/niche) — rejected per user instruction

## [2026-03-21] Architecture: two-tier extension system (x- / _x-)

**Category:** `architecture`
**Tags:** `tl-schema-org`, `extensions`, `api-design`

### Summary
Codified a two-tier naming convention for Schema.org extensions: `x-` prefix for public/consumer-facing properties, `_x-` prefix for internal/admin-only properties that get stripped before public API responses.

### Detail
- Pattern extracted from production e-commerce and concert data systems
- `x-` prefixed fields (e.g., `x-slug`, `x-abstract`, `x-performanceRank`) become part of the public API contract — consumers can rely on them
- `_x-` prefixed fields (e.g., `_x-displayOrder`, `_x-lastChecked`, `_x-sellerId`) are internal pipeline metadata that gets recursively stripped before any public response
- Field ordering convention: `@context` > `@type` > standard Schema.org properties > `x-` extensions > `_x-` internal
- This pattern sits at Level 3-4 in the extension decision framework, after (1) using existing Schema.org properties and (2) using `additionalProperty` with `PropertyValue`

## [2026-03-21] Quilting sources established for tl-schema-org

**Category:** `architecture`
**Tags:** `tl-schema-org`, `quilting`, `sources`

### Summary
Identified and weighted all source materials for the Schema.org quilted skill: 5 public sources for the published SKILL.md, plus 5 private/internal sources used for pattern extraction only.

### Detail
- **Public sources** (appear in SKILL.md quilted frontmatter):
  - `openclaw/schema-markup` (0.25) — validation checklist, common errors, React component
  - `aaron-he-zhu/schema-markup-generator` (0.25) — type decision tree, rich result matrix
  - Schema.org official docs (0.25) — data model, extensions, conformance, machine-readable files
  - Google Structured Data docs (0.10) — required/recommended properties, quality rules
  - W3C JSON-LD Best Practices (0.15) — @id/@graph patterns, vocabulary reuse
- **Private sources** (used for pattern extraction, NOT in published skill):
  - vip-playbook, catalog-parametric-search, tl-live-music-data (existing skills)
  - Private collectibles e-commerce project (two-tier extensions, field ordering, enum maps, UN/CEFACT codes, ProductModel pattern)
  - Private concert data API (OpenAPI type hierarchy, multi-source ID mapping)
- Database modeling approach: framework-agnostic SQL DDL patterns, not ORM-specific

## [2026-03-21] Initiated tl-schema-org quilted skill plan

**Category:** `milestone`
**Tags:** `tl-schema-org`, `planning`, `quilted-skill`, `schema-org`

### Summary
Started planning a comprehensive Schema.org quilted skill to make AI agents fluent across the entire 800+ type taxonomy — not just the ~15 types that SEO-focused skills cover.

### Detail
- User identified a gap: no existing skill covers Schema.org comprehensively. Community skills handle ~12 SEO types. Nothing addresses database modeling, API interoperability, extension governance, or the full type hierarchy.
- Scope defined as 7 core sections: fundamentals, JSON-LD rendering, extension patterns, database modeling, API interoperability, rich results/SEO, and version tracking
- JamBase API (`data.jambase.com`) examined as a reference implementation of Schema.org-grounded API design — OpenAPI schemas mirroring Schema.org types with `allOf` inheritance
- AllPreciousMetal project examined for production patterns — two-tier extensions, field ordering, enum mapping, UN/CEFACT unit codes, ProductModel/isVariantOf
- Plan created at `.cursor/plans/schema.org_quilted_skill_f01557b7.plan.md`
